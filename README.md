DiabloX is a mod for Diablo 1 and a fork of [DevilutionX](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX) with modifications to its code listed below.  The purpose of the changes is to increase the challenge by rebalancing various aspects of the game.

# How to Install

Note: You'll need access to the data from the original game. If you don't have an original CD then you can [buy Diablo from GoG.com](https://www.gog.com/game/diablo). Alternately you can use `spawn.mpq` from the [shareware](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionx-assets/releases/download/v2/spawn.mpq) version, in place of `DIABDAT.MPQ`, to play the shareware portion of the game.

Download the latest [DiabloX release](https://github.com/ikonomov/DiabloX/releases) and extract the contents to a location of your choosing.

- Copy `DIABDAT.MPQ` from the CD or GOG-installation (or [extract it from the GoG installer](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/wiki/Extracting-the-.MPQs-from-the-GoG-installer)) to the DiabloX folder.

More detailed instructions can be found by following the [Installation Instructions](./docs/installing.md) for DevilutionX.
