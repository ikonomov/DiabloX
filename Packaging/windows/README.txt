## How to Install

Note: You'll need access to the data from the original game. If you don't have an original CD then you can [buy Diablo from GoG.com](https://www.gog.com/game/diablo).

   * Download the latest [DiabloX release](https://github.com/ikonomov/DiabloX/releases) and extract the contents to a folder of your choosing.
   * Copy `DIABDAT.MPQ` from the CD or GOG-installation to the same folder.

## Multiplayer:
   * ZeroTier does not need port forwarding or an extra application.
