## How to Install

Note: You'll need access to the data from the original game. If you don't have an original CD then you can buy Diablo from GoG.com https://www.gog.com/game/diablo.

   * Download the latest DiabloX release https://github.com/ikonomov/DiabloX/releases and extract the contents to a location of your choosing.
   * Copy `DIABDAT.MPQ` from the CD or GOG-installation to the DiabloX folder.

## Multiplayer:
   * ZeroTier does not need port forwarding or an extra application.
   * TCP/IP requires the host to expose port 6112.
